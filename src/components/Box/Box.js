          Xiaomi is a Chinese manufacturer which is very popular in the Indian
          subcontinent for its smartphones and other consumer electronics
          accessories.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mi Smart Speaker is an affordable smart home speaker priced at
          just Rs.3,999. It comes with Google Assistant integration and competes
          against products such as Amazon Echo and Google Home.
        </p>
        <h3>Design and Build Quality</h3>
        <p>
          The elliptical-shaped Mi Smart Speaker has a rounded cylindrical
          design with a metal mesh grille sandwiched between high-quality ABS
          plastic frames.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the top, there are four touch-sensitive buttons including volume
          adjustment, forward, and microphone off buttons.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also an RGB LED light ring placed around the top surface
          which illuminates in different colours based on various actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the top surface, two far-field microphones are sensitive enough to
          detect the voice from a medium-sized room away.{" "}
        </p>
        <h3>Sound Quality</h3>
        <p>
          The Mi Smart Speaker has a front-facing single 63.5mm speaker driver
          with 12W output that is loud enough to fill a medium-sized room with
          sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quality of sound from this speaker is surprisingly rich with a
          decent amount of bass. The vocals sound crisp and the high-end treble
          notes are distinctly audible as well.{" "}
        </p>
        <h3>Smart Features</h3>
        <p>
          To make this smart speaker work, you need to download the ‚ÄúGoogle
          Home‚Äù application and pair the speaker with your Google account.
        </p>
        <p>
          After setting up this smart speaker you can start asking questions by
          adding ‚ÄúOk Google‚Äù in front of every sentence, just like what you do
          with the smartphone.{" "}

            If your primary aim is to listen to music in its full glory, we‚Äôd
            suggest you go for a full-fledged Bluetooth speaker instead of this
            smart speaker from Amazon.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>
          Primarily this is a smart home speaker so there‚Äôs more than just
          listening to songs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alexa, is the brain of the Echo Dot and since it is a cloud-based
          technology it will improve over some time and as you use it more it
          will adapt your usage and offers you the best experience.
